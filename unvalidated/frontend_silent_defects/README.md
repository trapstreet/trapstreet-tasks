# frontend_silent_defects — the page looks finished

**The version measured on 2026-09-06 did not discriminate** — three frontier
arms, six scored cases, eighteen scores, all 1.00. See [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md);
that verdict stands for that version and is not withdrawn.

**The instrument has since been rebuilt** with the two mechanisms from
[docs/raising-task-difficulty.md](../../docs/raising-task-difficulty.md) that a
one-shot generation task can actually use — generated hostile payloads and a
calibrated budget — on top of dense scoring. **The rebuilt version is unrun.**
It stays in `unvalidated/` until three arms go through it again.

## What it measures

A tool is given a brief and prints one self-contained HTML page. The judge opens
that page in real Chromium and asks things a screenshot cannot answer:

- **behaviour** — click the annual toggle. Do the prices change?
- **responsive** — at 375px, does anything stick out of the viewport?
- **robustness** — swap in a 240-character plan name. Does the layout hold?
- **constraints** — were the explicit prohibitions in the brief actually obeyed?

All of these fail *invisibly*. Two pages scoring 1.00 and 0.33 look the same side
by side, which is the reason this exists: a preference vote cannot find the
difference, because the voter is looking at the same picture.

## The cases

| case | family | what it varies |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | behaviour | baseline — one brief, plainly stated |
| 02 | constraints | constraint count, k≈7 (compositional load) |
| 03 | behaviour | a counterfactual requirement, against the obvious default |
| 04 | constraints | prohibitions — what the page must *not* do |
| 05 | behaviour | same checks as 01, brief padded with irrelevant context |
| 06 | robustness | 13 written + 40 generated hostile `__DATA__` payloads |
| 10 | constraints | a calibrated budget on nodes, CSS rules and bytes |
| 07–09 | open | free briefs — landing page, dashboard, form flow |

Cases 07–09 emit `score: null`. They run every check as a floor (loads, throws
nothing, survives 375px) and are reported as `floor_passed`, but nothing ranks
them. There is no gold that settles whether a landing page is good.

## What changed after the 18/18

**Scoring is dense.** `grade()` returns the fraction of the deciding family's
checks that passed, not 1.0-or-nothing. Binary cost nothing while every arm
scored 1.00; it becomes the dominant failure mode the moment a case is hard,
because every arm lands on 0.0 and the board cannot say which got closer.
Long-Horizon-Terminal-Bench measured 62.8% of runs making partial progress that
pass/fail discards. **Blockers** survive: a check the spec marks `blocker` takes
the case to zero — a page that executes injected content gets no partial credit.

**The hostile data is generated, not written.** `case_06` keeps its thirteen
written payloads and adds forty seeded generated ones over 29 hostile atoms —
lone surrogates, RTL overrides, 300 combining marks, prototype pollution, whole
`__DATA__` type swaps, five injection strings. A written list has a ceiling the
author can see; three frontier arms took the old thirteen 13/13. The recipe
crossing the process boundary is JSON-safe and the values are built in-page,
because `undefined`, `NaN` and cyclic objects do not survive serialisation.

It found a live XSS in this repo's own `fixtures/good.html` on the first run —
an `<img src=x onerror>` in a plan name executed. The fixture now builds nodes
instead of interpolating into `innerHTML`.

**`case_10` grades restraint against a calibrated ceiling.** 70 DOM elements,
42 CSS rules, 10,500 source bytes, all stated in the brief. The numbers come
from measuring the eighteen pages the three arms actually produced with no
budget stated: nodes ran 67–119, rules 39–61, bytes 9,475–16,473, and **exactly
one of the eighteen met all three at once**. Reachable, and not by accident.

This is as far as FrontierCode's scope discipline translates. It measures scope
against a reference patch; a page generated from a brief has no *before*, so
what survives is a stated ceiling rather than a comparison. Whether that is
enough to separate anything is the open question.

## Why contrast and labels are diagnostics, not score

The judge runs axe-core and publishes the counts, but they never move `score`.

A contrast failure is fixed by one bolt-on step: run a checker before returning.
Any tool can copy that the week it sees this board, so a score built on it would
saturate in one release cycle. Behaviour and robustness have no such step — a
dead toggle is fixed by building it right.

There is a second reason, found while testing rather than argued: on
`fixtures/broken.html` — a page with an unlabelled email input and two `<div>`s
acting as buttons — **axe's entire ruleset reports one thing, contrast.** `label`
does not fire, because a `placeholder` counts as an accessible name;
`button-name` does not fire, because a `<div>` has no button role to name. So the
a11y family is both the most gameable *and* the least sensitive. It rides along
because the counts are worth seeing, and for nothing else.

## Layout — and where the other half is

This directory is the **public half**: the briefs a tool is served, the case
list, and the write-up.

```
inputs/case_NN/brief.md   the brief handed to the solution — the whole of what
                          a solver sees
traptask.yaml             the case list, and nothing else
expected.sha256           a digest over the private half
README.md · RESULTS.md    method, findings, and what is still open
```

Everything that decides a score is held privately, in
`trapstreet-tasks-private/unvalidated/frontend_silent_defects/`:

```
expected/case_NN/   which family decides this case, and its assertions
judge.py            pulls the page out of stdout, calls the inspector,
                    turns one family into one score
grader.py           aggregates cases into the run score
check/inspect.mjs   the browser half — puppeteer-core against system Chrome,
                    axe-core injected. Runs the assertions, generates the
                    hostile payloads, walks multi-step UIs and captures each
                    state, emits rects.json for the gallery overlay
check/checklists/   ten items per brief — the LLM judge's rubric
check/checklist_score.py   scores one page against its brief's checklist
check/pairwise_gate.py     validates that scorer against human labels
check/panel.py · check/anchors/   the superseded pointwise panel, kept as record
fixtures/           good / broken / counterfactual / wizard / overbuilt —
                    the judge's own test set
tests/              end-to-end through the real judge
labels/             the owner's human judgments, and the runs measured against
                    them
tools/gold_hash.py  regenerates expected.sha256 into both halves
```

**`tp run` will not score against this directory.** That is the point: with gold
public a task is permanently self-reported, and this one is new enough to be
built the other way. The digest is what buys the privacy back — it fixes the
hidden half in place so it stays checkable, and it covers the inspector and the
checklists as well as `expected/`, because the inspector *generates* the hostile
payloads and the checklists *are* the LLM judge's rubric. Change either and a
score moves with `expected/` untouched.

The inspector needs Node and a Chrome on the machine; it downloads no browser.
Set `CHROME_PATH` if Chrome is not at the macOS default.

## First real run, 2026-08-31 — and the judge bug it found

One arm (`opus-ceiling`, a bare `claude-opus-5` relay) over the six scored cases.

**It passed everything.** 20/20 on the five levers, then 13/13 on the hostile-data
case. The task does not currently separate anything at the frontier.

The hostile-data case *appeared* to catch it — 0.0, "1 element(s) clip their
content" on the 240-character plan name. That was the judge being wrong. The page
had line-clamped the heading to three lines, added an ellipsis, and put the full
string in a `title` attribute: correct handling, better than this repo's own
`fixtures/good.html`, which simply wraps. The check now fires only when content
vanishes with **no** affordance — no ellipsis, no title, no aria-label.

Two things follow. The repo's claim that every task's first real run turns up a
judge defect held again. And the axis is wrong: METR measures task length as the
dominant predictor of agent success (R²=0.83), with frontier models near-100%
under about four human-minutes. This brief is a ten-minute job. No number of
extra constraints closes that gap.

## The judge panel, and why it is not wired in

`check/panel.py` is a three-lens LLM judge — a design director who sees the
render, an engineer who sees only the source, a client checking the brief — over
four axes on a 1–3 forced choice, calibrated against seven screenshots the task
owner sorted blind on that same scale. The method is written up in
[docs/writing-a-judge-rubric.md](../../docs/writing-a-judge-rubric.md).

It was run twice over nine pages from three different labs, authors hidden, and
appeared to fail badly: two pages sitting in its own prompt labelled "2" came
back 3.00 and 2.75, its ranking contradicted the owner's held-out judgments, the
mean swing between runs was 0.36 on a 1–3 scale, and `1` was never used once
across 72 scores.

**Then the ground truth turned out to be partly wrong.** Elicited pairwise
instead — nine same-brief pairs, each shown twice with the sides swapped — the
owner agreed with herself 9/9 with no position bias, and every brief came out
transitive. Two of the three briefs reproduced her earlier overall sort. The
landing brief inverted completely: `good_landing.jpg`, the level-3 landing
anchor, is the page she now ranks *last* of three. So "it contradicted its own
anchors" was, on that page, the anchor being wrong.

So the panel was rebuilt as a **pairwise** judge — two attempts at one brief,
the same words she was given, forced choice — and put through a gate written
before it ran: nine same-brief pairs with the first/second order balanced,
stop at ≤6/9, and ≥8/9 to pass.

**It scored 5/9. Chance is 4.5.** It picked the first-shown page 4 times out of
9 and her page was first 4 times out of 9, so position bias explains nothing.
Per brief: dashboard 3/3, landing 1/3, form 1/3. Stage 2 was not bought.

That is the honest verdict the anchor mismatch was not. The judge is out of the
score and out of the diagnostics, and `check/panel.py`, `check/anchors/` and
`check/pairwise_gate.py` are kept only as record.

One confound and one hypothesis, both worth carrying. The form stimuli are
pre-walker captures showing about two of eleven fields, so that brief was never
fairly asked — the landing brief was, and it went 1/3. And every reason the
judge gave is about information completeness or reassurance: "concrete proof",
"scannable", "all key metrics", "reassuring microcopy". It reads the copy and
the feature inventory. On a dashboard, where completeness genuinely is the job,
it goes 3/3; where restraint decides it, 2/6. With n=9 that is a mechanism worth
naming, not a finding.

Three findings survive, and the first is the one worth carrying:

1. **Check the labels before blaming the judge.** Her pointwise good/bad labels
   inverted on a third of the material; her pairwise ones held 9/9. Ask a human
   for comparisons, not grades.
2. **A within-brief order is ordinal, not absolute.** Knowing 07B beats the
   other two landings does not make it a "3", so `anchors.json` cannot be
   rebuilt from this data — which is the real argument for moving both the
   elicitation and the judge to pairwise, more than anchor count ever was.
3. **The form cases were never judgeable from an image at all**: those pages are
   exactly one viewport tall because steps 2–4 do not exist until a click, so
   every capture showed two of eleven fields. That one was a defect in the
   *input*, not the judge, and it is fixed — see below.

## Capturing a UI that has states

Fixed 2026-09-05, after the panel run made the cost visible.

The inspector now **walks** the page instead of photographing it once. It fills
the visible fields with plausible values, presses the control that reads like
"next", and captures again — up to four states, stopping the moment a click
changes nothing or would leave the page. Each state is captured as 1280×1600
tiles, so neither the fold nor legibility is lost. `states_captured` and, per
state, the label it pressed are reported.

Open briefs cannot declare a click path — we do not know the selectors — so this
is a heuristic and it is honest about being one: it reports what it pressed, and
a page it cannot advance simply reports one state. `fixtures/wizard.html` is a
three-step form whose steps 2 and 3 are not in the DOM until step 1 validates,
and `tests/test_judge.py` fails if the walker stops short of it.

This does not rescue the panel. It removes one reason the panel had no chance.

## Known open questions

Most of these were answered by the run in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).

- ~~**Does it discriminate?**~~ Answered 2026-09-06: no. Every case is
  zero-variance across three frontier arms, so by the task's own gate every case
  gets cut, which is the whole task.
- ~~**A "cheat arm" is planned**~~ — moot. It was going to show that the a11y
  families saturate on one bolt-on step; there is no scored family left to
  protect.
- **`expected/` is readable by solutions.** trap-cli runs solutions unsandboxed
  with an absolute `inputs_dir`, and the assertions are in `expected/`. For a
  build task that is less broken than it sounds (satisfying the assertions *is*
  the job), but a solution can target the exact checks instead of building well,
  and that has to be handled before this ships.
- **Cases 07–09 have never run through `tp run`.** They were generated out of
  band for the anchor set. Note that an arm with a low `max_tokens` will truncate
  on an open brief and score `no_html` — a contract miss, not a capability
  failure, and `contract_miss` marks it as such.
